# Based on Breaknix sample mod to remove flags.
This mod removes on maps the flags with the gunship/dropship spawn
when the infinateVehicles mod from Powback is used.

The Gunship and the dropship will crash the server if
infinatevehicles mod is used

On default the inifinatevehicles mod (ext/server) is enabled.
Keep in mind, on other maps there is also a extra vehicles spawn.
